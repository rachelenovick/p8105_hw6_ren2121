## Problem 1

Reading in the dataset from github:

```{r}
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/washingtonpost/data-homicides/master/homicide-data.csv"

homicides = read_csv(url)
```

Creating a city_state variable, and a binary variable indicating whether the homicide is solved.

```{r}
homicides =
  homicides |> 
  mutate(
    city_state = paste(city, state, sep = ", "),
    solved = case_when(
      disposition %in% c("Closed without arrest", "Open/No arrest") ~ 0,
      disposition == "Closed by arrest" ~ 1
  ))
```
